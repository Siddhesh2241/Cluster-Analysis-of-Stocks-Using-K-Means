# Stock Clustering Analysis Using K-Means

This project involves clustering stock data into groups based on their returns and variance using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The analysis provides insights into stock trends, enabling investors to categorize stocks as bullish, moderately bullish, moderately bearish, or bearish. The project also saves clustered data into separate CSV files for further analysis.

## Features

## Data Preprocessing:

Stock data is analyzed for two key parameters: Returns and Variance.

## K-Means Clustering:

Stocks are clustered into four distinct groups:
- **Cluster 0 (Bearish)** : High risk with significant negative returns.
- **Cluster 1 (Moderate Bullish)** : Stable stocks with low variance.
- **Cluster 2 (Bullish)** : High-return stocks with manageable risk.
- **Cluster 3 (Moderate Bearish)** : Underperforming stocks with potential for recovery.

Stock Trend Classification:

Stocks are labeled as Bullish, Moderate Bullish, Moderate Bearish, or Bearish based on their cluster assignments.
Grouping and Saving:

Stocks are grouped by trend, and separate CSV files are created for each trend, with the filename including the date of saving for easy identification.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Run the script:

Load your stock data into the script and execute the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Analyze results:

Scatter plots visualize the clusters based on Returns and Variance.
Save grouped data:

The clustered stocks are saved as CSV files named after their respective trends (e.g., Bullish_stocks_<date>.csv).
Output
Scatter Plot: A graphical representation of the clusters, showing stocks grouped by their returns and variance.
Clustered Data: CSV files for each trend containing stock symbols, variance, returns, cluster labels, and stock trend classification.
Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights into stock performance:

Cluster 2 (Bullish): Ideal for growth-oriented investments.
Cluster 1 (Moderate Bullish): Suitable for conservative investors seeking stability.
Cluster 0 (Bearish): High-risk stocks to avoid or trade cautiously.
Cluster 3 (Moderate Bearish): Underperforming stocks that may offer recovery potential.
Future Enhancements
Integrating live stock data for real-time clustering.
Adding advanced visualizations and heatmaps.
Extending clustering analysis to incorporate more features like volume and market capitalization.
Building a web-based interface for easier usability.

Stock Clustering Analysis Using K-Means
This project performs clustering on stock data to classify stocks into different trends based on returns and variance using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The analysis helps investors categorize stocks as Bullish, Moderately Bullish, Moderately Bearish, or Bearish.

Data Source
The stock data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using historical stock price data.
Data includes key metrics such as daily returns and variance calculated from the stock price data over a specific time period.
Features
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and analyze stock price data to calculate Returns and Variance.
Clustering with K-Means:

Stocks are grouped into four clusters:
Cluster 0 (Bearish): High risk, negative returns.
Cluster 1 (Moderate Bullish): Stable stocks with low variance.
Cluster 2 (Bullish): High-return stocks with manageable variance.
Cluster 3 (Moderate Bearish): Underperforming stocks with potential recovery opportunities.
Trend Classification:

A new column, Stock Trend, is added to classify each stock based on its cluster label.
Grouping and Exporting Data:

Stocks are grouped by trends (Bullish, Moderate Bullish, Moderate Bearish, Bearish).
CSV files are saved for each trend with the date of saving included in the filename (e.g., Bullish_stocks_2025-01-09.csv).
Visualization:

Scatter plots visualize clusters, showing the relationship between Returns and Variance.
How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the Stock_Clustering.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Follow the step-by-step code cells to preprocess data, perform clustering, and analyze results.
Save and Analyze Results:

After running the notebook, the results will be saved as CSV files for each trend.
Notebook Screenshots
Here are some visual outputs generated during the analysis:

Clustered Data Table:
(Add a screenshot of the data table showing clustered stock data)

Output
CSV Files: Clustered stock data saved as separate CSV files based on trends:

Bullish_stocks_<date>.csv
Moderate_Bullish_stocks_<date>.csv
Moderate_Bearish_stocks_<date>.csv
Bearish_stocks_<date>.csv
Plots: Visualizations of clusters using scatter plots to understand stock behavior.

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights for investors:

Cluster 2 (Bullish): High returns, manageable risk; ideal for growth investments.
Cluster 1 (Moderate Bullish): Low risk, stable returns; suitable for conservative investors.
Cluster 0 (Bearish): High-risk stocks with significant negative returns; should be avoided.
Cluster 3 (Moderate Bearish): Underperforming stocks; invest cautiously with potential recovery opportunities.
Future Enhancements
Automate data fetching from Yahoo Finance or APIs for real-time updates.
Add more parameters like volume, market capitalization, or price-to-earnings ratio to improve clustering accuracy.
Build a web-based application using Streamlit for easier usability and analysis.
